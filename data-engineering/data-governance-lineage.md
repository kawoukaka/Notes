# Data Governance and Lineage

## Governance Goals
- Define data ownership and stewardship.
- Ensure compliance (PII, retention, access control).
- Standardize naming, schemas, and definitions.

## Lineage
- Track source to sink across pipelines.
- Enable impact analysis for schema changes.
- Support auditing and incident forensics.

## Real-World Examples
- Data catalog with owners, SLAs, and freshness metadata.
- Column-level lineage for regulated datasets.

## Senior mindset
- Automate metadata capture; manual lineage will drift.
- Tie governance to access control and review workflows.

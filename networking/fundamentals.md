# Networking Fundamentals

## Core Concepts
- OSI vs TCP/IP models; know where issues map.
- TCP vs UDP tradeoffs for reliability vs latency.
- MTU and fragmentation effects on throughput.

## Senior Notes
- Design around latency and tail behavior, not just averages.
- Understand connection reuse and keep-alive tuning.
- Plan for packet loss and retries in distributed systems.

# Security and Segmentation

## Core Topics
- Network segmentation using VPCs, subnets, and security groups.
- Zero trust principles and least privilege.
- TLS termination and certificate management.

## Senior Notes
- Treat lateral movement as a primary threat model.
- Enforce egress controls and audit for exfiltration risk.
- Use mTLS for service-to-service identity where possible.

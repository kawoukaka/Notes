# Reliability Engineering (SRE)

## Core Concepts
- SLOs/SLIs/SLAs define reliability targets.
- Error budgets guide release velocity and risk.
- Reliability is a product requirement, not just operations.

## Practices
- Define golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, saturation.
- Automate runbooks and remediation where safe.
- Use chaos experiments to validate resilience.

## Incident Management
- Fast detection and clear incident roles.
- Blameless postmortems with actionable follow-ups.
- Track recurring issues and eliminate root causes.

## Senior mindset
- Balance innovation with reliability risk.
- Prioritize systemic fixes over one-off patches.
